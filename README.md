Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

In this assignment, we were asked to call to earthquake data found on the USGS website and develop a map to show the coordinates of the most recent earthquakes. 

Data can be found here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

In order to access the data, I called to the geoJSON link using d3 and used leaflet to pull to the maps. The data provided contained latitude and longitude coordinates, which allowed for me to map the earthquake data on the maps. 

The finished product demonstrates the most recent earthquake activity and can be viewed in three different style maps (Outdoor, Satellite, and Grayscale). Each marker will display the time, date and magnitude of the earthquake. The legend and map styles can be found on the far right side of the page.
